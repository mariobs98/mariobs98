- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mariobs98
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... More Python!

My name is Mario and I am passionate about technology. I have a special interest with a desire to learn and develop professionally in topics related to: Cybersecurity, deep learning / machine learning, robotics, real-time systems or anything related to GPU/CPU architectures, hardware or more general areas of programming.

I consider myself an inquisitive person with a desire to learn about topics that are of interest me. I have never had a problem working in a team or on my own. I am a person who likes to get involved, and who has a dedicated ability to learn and function in all environments related to technology.

I have knowledge in C/C++, Java, Assembler, Python, ADA, HTML5 and CSS, and I also have no problem learning any other type of programming language, as well as with any other type of technology and environment. In turn, I handle both Windows and Linux, and, in the latter, I also have knowledge of bash scripting.

I have an upper-intermediate level in English, especially in reading and listening.
