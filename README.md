- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mariobs98
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... More Python!

My name is Mario and I am passionate about technology. 
I am a Computer Engineer with a special interest, desire to learn and develop professionally in topics related to: Cybersecurity, deep learning/machine learning, robotics, real-time systems or everything related to GPU/CPU architectures or programming more generally.

I consider myself a curious person with a desire to learn about the topics that especially interest me. At the same time, I have never had a problem working in a team or establishing a relationship with anyone. I also consider myself a person who gets involved, and who has a certain facility to learn and function in these environments related to technology.

I have knowledge in C/C++, Java, Assembler, Python, ADA, HTML5 or CSS, and I have no problem getting up to speed with these or any other type of programming language, as well as with any type of technology and environment. In turn, I handle both Windows and Linux, and, in the latter, I also have knowledge of bash scripting.

Upper-intermediate level in English, especially in reading and listening.
